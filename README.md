# Support Vector Voting Networks

In this research, a newer vesion of support vector machines is
suggested to solve the computation problem in SMO in a much faster
way.

## Sequential Minimal Optimization
A Simplified Implementation of SMO is implemented as the core of the
algorithm.

## Objective

Independent Study task to understand the parallelism in Support Vector Machines algorithm.

## Introduction
In this project the code describes a Simplified Sequential Minimal
Optimization for Support Vector Machines along with a voting mechanism
to get a faster implementation of SVM in Kernel Matrix computation
model.

## Code Implementation
